# Plain Design System

This repository hosts the design system components built with MUI Base.

It serves as a reference for builing custom design systems.

See all the components in [the Storybook hosted on Chromatic](https://main--632b14aec65017358bd54b76.chromatic.com).  
You can also run the Storybook locally by executing `yarn storybook`.

To build the project, run `yarn build`.
Note that the output files are not bundled together.
They are built as ES modules, so they can be consumed independently.
