# Rebased Design System

This repository hosts the design system components built with MUI Base.

It serves as a reference for builing custom design systems.

See all the components in [the Storybook hosted on Chromatic](https://main--632b14aec65017358bd54b76.chromatic.com).  
You can also run the Storybook locally by executing `pnpm storybook`.

To build the project, run `pnpm build`.
The library is built and bundled with Vite.
The output bundles and TypeScript definition files are created in the build directory.

## Libraries used

* [MUI Base](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) - provides logic and accessibility support for all controls.
* [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) - helps constructing class names for components.
